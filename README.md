## 1.Install

### npm

```
npm i
or
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
To fix version conflicts, that stops the installation process.
The --legacy-peer-deps flag was introduced with v7 as a way to bypass peerDependency auto-installation; it tells NPM to ignore peer deps and proceed with the installation anyway. This is how things used to be with NPM v4 thru v6.
```

### yarn

```
yarn install
```

## 2.Start

```sh
npm start
or
yarn start
```

## 3.Build

```sh
npm run build or yarn build
```
